# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis:
The overview of this analysis is to show the total fare of each city type and to figure out an action based on the results.

Results: 
The Urban city type had $39,854.38 in total fares, 1,625 in total rides, 2,405 total drivers, an average fare per ride was $24.52 and the average fare per driver was $16.57.
The Suburban city type had $19.356.33 in total fares, 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, an average fare per ride was $30.97, and an average fare per driver was $39.50.
The Rural city type had $4,327.93 in total fares, 125 in total rides, 78 total drivers, an average fare per ride was $34.62, and an average fare per driver was $55.48 

Summary: 
The Urban city type had the highest total fare but the lowest average fare per driver, while the Rural city type had the lowest fare with the highest average fare per driver. This is because there drivers in Urban cities receive more rides which allows them to make a decent amount of money due to the high demand. Whereas the Rural city type is the opposite, the drivers in rural cities receive less rides which means that the rides cost more due to there being a lack of drivers in these areas.
I would recommend raising prices slightly in urban areas so that drivers receive more for their labor.
I would also recommend creating a campaign to get more drivers in rural areas so prices will be more affordable.
